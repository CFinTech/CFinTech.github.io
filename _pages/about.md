👋 Hi there! I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in CS (Elite class) at [Guohao College, Tongji University](https://ghc.tongji.edu.cn/). My research interests include **Efficient AI**, especially [Implicit Neural Representation](https://github.com/CFinTech/awesome-implicit-neural-representations) and Second-Order Information Pruning. 

Due to my previous entrepreneurial project experience, I have some **industry insights** in the field of **high-rise building maintenance**. If you are interested in the inspection and maintenance of high-rise building facades, feel free to reach out to me!

I am strongly determined to pursue a PhD and will actively seek **2026 fall PhD opportunities**.
