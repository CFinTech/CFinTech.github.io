ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in CS (Elite class) at [Guohao College, Tongji University](https://ghc.tongji.edu.cn/) My research interests include **3D Computer Vision** and **Computer Grapics**, especially [Implicit Neural Representation](https://github.com/CFinTech/awesome-implicit-neural-representations). I am now working on efficient 3D scene representation research, advised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/).

Due to my previous entrepreneurial project experience, I have some **industry insights** in the field of **high-rise building maintenance**. If you are interested in the inspection and maintenance of high-rise building facades, feel free to reach out to me!

I am strongly determined to pursue a PhD and will actively seek **2026 fall PhD opportunities**.
