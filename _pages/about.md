👋 Hi there! I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in CS (Elite class) at [Guohao College, Tongji University](https://ghc.tongji.edu.cn/), with the **rank 1/52**. My research interests include **Efficient AI**, especially focus on promoting both the efficiency and performance of (Multimodal) Large Language Models. I'm fortunatly working with [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at Westlake University.

Due to my previous entrepreneurial project experience, I have some **industry insights** in the field of **high-rise building maintenance**. If you are interested in the inspection and maintenance of high-rise building facades, feel free to reach out to me!

<!-- I am actively seeking **2026 fall PhD opportunities**. -->
